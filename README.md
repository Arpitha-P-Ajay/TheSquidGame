## Basic Details
### Team Name: --(Individual)--


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Arpitha P Ajay - LBS Institute Of Technology for Women Poojappura Thiruvananthapuram

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
The Squid Game web app recreates iconic game from the TV show in a browser-based format, letting users play the game ‚ÄúRed Light, Green Light‚Äù in a virtual environment. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Remember the childhood game "Red Light, Green Light"? It's nearly impossible to play alone - you need someone to watch and catch you moving during red lights. But what if AI could be your game master, watching your every move through your webcam ?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Finally you can play without judgements!
